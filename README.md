The goal of this assignment, was to design an intelligent agent capable of navigating through a maze. I was responsible for designing the agent's episodic loop. This loop involved, analyzing its current state, making a 
decision, and saving the decision and episode to memory. Everything else was prebuilt and all I did with the pre designed code was read it to gain insight on its structure and functionality.

Computer scientists solve problems. These problems vary in scope and relevance, but that is the core of the work that a computer scientist does. Real people have real problems, which we break down, analyze and then solve 
through software and hardware.

My preferred approach when presented with a problem is data gathering and analysis. Who is affected by the problem? How many people are affected? Is there already a solution that can be improved upon? These kinds of questions
motivate me to solve problems efficiently and with a higher success rate.
My ethical responsibilites lie with the the end user as much as they do with the organization. To the organization, I am responsible for completing tasks as they are given to, and to the best of my abilities. And to the end 
user, I am responsible for solving their problems, while providing them safe, secure software to that end.
